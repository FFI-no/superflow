/// \brief Being the sister of Metronome and Throttle, Sleeper is the third way of rate control.
/// Typically intended to be used within a for-loop in order to stall execution.
/// Sleeper will sleep until another `period` has passed since the previous call to `sleepForRemainderOfPeriod`, thus a steady rate.
/// You can also adjust the sleep period with Â´setNewSleepPeriod(Clock::duration period);`
///
/// ```cpp
/// using namespace std::chrono_literals;
/// const Sleeper rate_limiter(10ms);
///
/// for (const auto& data : *latched_port_)
/// {
///   do_work();
///   rate_limiter.sleepForRemainderOfPeriod();  // Sleep for the rest of the period
///
///   if(some condition)
///   {
///      rate_limiter.setNewSleepPeriod(xms);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
///
/// If execution time of `do_work()` is less than 10ms, it will not be called again until 10ms has passed since
/// the previous call. If execution time is > 10ms, it will be called again immediately as sleepForRemainderOfPeriod time is already due.
///
